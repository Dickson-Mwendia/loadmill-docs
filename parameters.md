# Parameters

Learn how to use parametrization with [Loadmill](https://www.loadmill.com).

## Introduction

Working with [Loadmill](https://www.loadmill.com) makes it very easy to convert recorded browser/netwrok sessions (via HAR files) into test scenarios. But once a scenario has been created, it often needs to **parametrized** in order to denote the dynamic parts of your API.

This is best explained by example, so let's have a look at the following test scenario:

1. User adds a blog post: `curl https://www.myblog.com/posts --data "Hello World"`
2. User likes his own post: `curl -X PUT https://www.myblog.com/posts/123/like`

The `123` part is the identifier of the blog post created by the user - it cannot be known in advance because it is generated by the server at runtime. This is a very common use case for **parameters** and is handeled by two simple steps:

1. [Extract]() the ID from the first response into a parameter: `postId`
2. [Embed the parameter]() in the second request URL: `https://www.myblog.com/posts/${postId}/like`

You may embed parameters with the `${}` syntax in the request URL as well as the request body, request headers, [extractions](), [assertions]() and [more]().

## Default Parameters

Another common use case for parametrization is when you want to **reuse test scenarios** on different environments or with small adjustments.

Let's extend our first example by requiring that the user provide credentials via **basic authentication**. This means our new URLs could look like this:

1. `https://user:password@www.myblog.com/posts`
2. `https://user:password@www.myblog.com/posts/${postId}/like`

If you would like to use different credentials for every test run, you may replace the user
