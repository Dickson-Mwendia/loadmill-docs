# Load Testing

After validating your APIs for regression bugs, it is important to make sure that they perform well **under load**.

Loadmill helps companies avoid expensive downtime by replicating production traffic in test environments.

Using real Internet traffic, Loadmill enables developers to capture real-world complexities in their test environments, while helping prevent issues and bottlenecks that are usually only detected in production.

By leveraging real user recordings, and replaying them on different devices around the world, Loadmill can predict exactly what is going to happen **every time you release to production**.
