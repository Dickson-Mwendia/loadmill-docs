**GitHub** is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets users work together on projects from anywhere.

With our integration with GitHub, you can easily integrate your Loadmill tests with your GitHub repository and [they will run per each successful release of your app](https://docs.loadmill.com/integrations/github-integration/ci-integration). In addition, the integration enables you [to create a backup of your Test Suites in GitHub](https://docs.loadmill.com/integrations/github-integration/data-sync-connection-to-github) and easily track changes made to them.
