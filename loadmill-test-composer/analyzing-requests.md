# Analyzing Requests

What makes the Loadmill Composer unique is the “Analyze Requests” feature. It allows the AI to process and analyze how each request will affect your API test and what kind of parameters you need in order to make it dynamic, allowing the test to be ready for any environment.

To start correlating your flow, click “Analyze Requests”.

**After creating a flow, hit “Pause”, so it does not register any incoming API calls. This will keep your API resources from being used unnecessarily.**
