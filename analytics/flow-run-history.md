# Flow Run History

We understand how crucial is to review API automated test runs, see the test flow timeline and easily detect how often and when the test flow fails.

All the above can be done by using the Flow Run History feature.&#x20;

Navigate to the Test Suite Run => Enter a relevant Test Flow => Click on the "FLOW HISTORY" button.&#x20;

You are redirected to the Flow Run History page where you can see all runs of the test flow, apply various filters and download the table as CSV for sharing with other colleagues:
