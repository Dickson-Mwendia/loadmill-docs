# Recordings settings

Use the advanced Recordings settings to create meaningful replay-able tests that are easy to configure. Team Admins can control these settings [on this page](https://www.loadmill.com/app/user/settings/recordings). 

{% hint style="info" %}
ðŸ‘‡ You can configure the settings below for our [recorder](https://docs.loadmill.com/working-with-the-recorder#loadmill-node-recorder) & [Chrome recorder extension](https://docs.loadmill.com/working-with-the-recorder#loadmill-chrome-recorder-extension). 
{% endhint %}

### Split sessions by URLs \(for the Recorder use only\)

In general we want the test cases created based on recorded data, to be short and focused as possible. By default, Loadmill will split a recorded user session into two separate Loadmill test flow, if the user hasn't been active for 5 minutes. 

In many cases, you will want to control when a session is split into separate test cases. Using this setting, you can add API URLs that will define the beginning of a new test case each time they are called.

{% hint style="warning" %}
ðŸ§  **Note:** You can also use raw JavaScript to fire an event from your code to splits a recorded session:`navigator.serviceWorker.controller.postMessage({ type: "reset-session" });`
{% endhint %}

### URL Filters

Use this setting to filter API calls that are not relevant for your tests i.e. marketing, monitoring, analytics and other external integrations.

### Special Keys

Use this setting to manage important Special Keys located in your POST requests body. This way, we can make sure they wonâ€™t be missed during the recording processing phase.

### Entities Synonyms

Entities Synonyms help us to detect same entities with different names like a 'Jet' and an 'Airplane'.

Here you can add and manage entities synonyms. This way, we can make sure they wonâ€™t be missed during the recording processing phase. Synonyms must be entered in a list and separated by commas. i.e. Plane, Aircraft, Jet.

### Ignored Keys

Ignored keys are a list of keys that will be ignored while generating tests from recordings.  
Keys in this list will never be extracted to a parameter in the created tests.

### Default values

Default values are a list of keys that once detected will be assigned with a default value. This value may be overridden on runtime.

### Non-Secret Keys \(for the Recorder use only\)

Non-secret keys will be used to identify and record values even when recording in secure mode.  
Keys and paths to identify non-secret values are given in a JSONPath-like syntax.

{% hint style="warning" %}
\*\*\*\*ðŸ§  **Note** : Do not record private user data. It is recommended to test these keys locally before recording real users.
{% endhint %}

### Regex replacers

Regex replacers will be used to identify any strings that match the regex and extract them as a parameter.
