### Pairing your Test Suite

You can pair your Loadmill suite to an existing TestRail suite or have Loadmill create a new TestRail Test Suite every time you pair your Loadmill suite. Every test runs will automatically report to the TestRail suite the Loadmill suite is assigned to.

{% hint style="warning" %}
To enable Test Suite Pairing you need to enable CI for the desired flow. This is an essential step as it automates Xray reports on run.
{% endhint %}

### TestRail Results

Running your test case will trigger a TestRail Test Run report on the selected TestRail suite. You can view your TestRail report to keep track of the data and test runs. This is an exciting way to ensure that your tests are being run as planned and that you're getting the most accurate results possible.

You can access your TestRail results from the Loadmill Test Run results and vice versa. Simply open the "Configuration" of your Loadmill Test Run and click on the TestRail Suite ID to access your TestRail results. From TestRail, select the Test Runs & Results tab > Open a Test Run and click on the link from the run description.
