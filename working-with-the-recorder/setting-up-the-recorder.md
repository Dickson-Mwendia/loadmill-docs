1. **Serve Loadmill worker.js from your domain:**  The Loadmill service worker has to be served from your domain in order to record it. Upload this [loadmill-worker.js](https://echo.loadmill.com/loadmill-worker.js) file to your static resources folder, and make sure it is available at &lt;your-domain&gt;/loadmill-worker.js
