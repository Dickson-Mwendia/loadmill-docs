**Domain verification**

Q: I’m getting an error ‘Unverified domains are already under test’ but our domain has been verified. What do I miss here?

A: Please make sure your tests are not using other domains like facebook, salesforce etc. Contact support at [support@loadmill.com](mailto:support@loadmill.com) if you need [an additional domain to get verified](https://docs.loadmill.com/load-testing/setup/domain-verification) or any other assistance is required.
