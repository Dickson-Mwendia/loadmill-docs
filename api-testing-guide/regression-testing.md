# Regression Testing

#### How do developers create their regression tests?

Regression testing is a process of testing changes to software to make sure that the new code doesn't break existing functionality. It's an important part of the software development process, but it can be time-consuming and expensive.

There are a few different ways that developers can create regression test suites for APIs. One common way is to use a tool like SoapUI or Postman. These tools allow developers to create test cases and run them against an API to ensure that the API is functioning correctly.

Another way to create a regression test suite is to manually write code that makes calls to the API and verifies the results. This approach requires more work up front, but it can be more flexible and allow for more comprehensive testing.

#### The issue many companies have in testing their servers

Today, many organizations are struggling with regression testing. They're finding that it's taking longer and longer to test their software, and they're not able to keep up with the pace of change. As a result, they're missing bugs and releasing software with serious defects.

There are several reasons for this problem. One is that software is becoming increasingly complex. Another is that the pace of change is accelerating, making it harder to keep track of all the changes that need to be tested.

Finally, many organizations are under pressure to release new features and products quickly, which leaves less time for regression testing. As a result, they're forced to cut corners and take shortcuts that can lead to serious defects in their software.
