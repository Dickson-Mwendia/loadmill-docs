# Test Flow editor

API Test flow is a series of API calls \(HTTP requests\) that represent a single "user" flow we would like to test. These requests will be executed sequentially until completion or until the first failure.

**Run Flow button** \(â–¶\) - Run the edited flow as a "Dry run" to debug and validate it.

**Export Flow** - Save the flow to a `.JSON` file. You can then import the flow into anther test suite or as a load test.

**Replace parameter** - Replace the usage of a parameter in this flow with another parameter \(Parameters will be discussed later in depth\) 

**CI toggle** - Toggle this switch to enable the flow to run when executed from your continuous integration pipeline. You can use our NPM module to execute a Test Suite to test every build in CI, this will be explained lated in the Integrations section.

Other flow controllers  include -

**Add Request button** - Add new requests to a flow. Once added you can drag a request to change its order by grabbing it at the top right corner.
