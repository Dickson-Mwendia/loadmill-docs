# ðŸŽ¥Recordings

We've developed **a smart recorder** that allows users to capture traffic in the QA or Production environment and replay it as API tests.

### How it works

* Create a new recording from the [Recordings tab in Loadmill.](https://www.loadmill.com/app/recordings/my-recordings) 
* Play your test scenarios in the recorded app. By default, the traffic is split to different sessions by its source \(different IPs\) and intermissions between user actions. \(If you with to manually split a recorded session in your test environment you can use the [Loadmill session splitter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/loadmill-session-splitter/beknfelcpakgnojjfcdpjddhnckekhni), else you can use our [advanced Recordings settings](https://app.gitbook.com/@loadmill/s/docs/~/drafts/-MNYgtUZoEcRuSmuiHya/working-with-the-recorder/recorder-settings)\)
* When you're ready, stop the recording and [generate a Test Suite from it](https://app.gitbook.com/@loadmill/s/docs/~/drafts/-MNYgtUZoEcRuSmuiHya/working-with-the-recorder/working-with-the-recorder). 

See how to set the recorder up in [the next guide](https://docs.loadmill.com/working-with-the-recorder/setting-up-the-recorder).
