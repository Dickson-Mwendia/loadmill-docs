## Loadmill in 5 minutes
In this short introduction to Loadmill we will learn how to:

1. Create and run a very simple load test in just a few seconds.
2. Record a user session with a browser and import it to Loadmill.
3. Transform the recorded session into an advanced test scenario.
4. Run the advanced load test and analyze the results.

We are going to be testing a [Ghost](https://ghost.org/developers/) publishing service hosted on Heroku that you can actually download/fork and play with yourself if you so desire.

Everything described here is demonstrated in the video above so be sure to check it out.

## Free Account
Before you can start running free tests, you will need to create a Loadmill account. We do not ask for any credit card or personal information other your name and email so it only takes about five seconds. You can also login using your Google or GitHub account.

## Hello World
The simplest load test you can create is an HTTP GET request to your web server. All you need to do is:

1. Click on **NEW TEST** on the top navigation menu. This will get you to our test editor.
2. Copy and paste the website URL into the **URL** text box. In our case, it's going to be `https://loadmill-test-blog.herokuapp.com`.
3. Click the **LOAD TEST** button and confirm the config by clicking **RUN**.

**Note:** At some point you may notice a message stating that your domain is not _verified_ - this only means that you may not run high volume tests before proving ownership of your domain/hostname. You can ignore it for now and learn how to do that later [here](domain-verification.html) \(it's actually pretty easy\).

That's it! You have just created and ran your first load test in under a minute üéâ

## Record A Session
Any modern browser that has **Developer Tools** such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge or Safari, has a **Network Tab** in which you can view and **record HTTP requests** of your session. If your tested application has a web interface, recording a browser session is a pretty fast and straight forward way to create advanced tests for common user scenarios.

The user story we would like to record is the following:

1. A blogger logs in to the Ghost platform using a username and password.
2. The blogger creates a blog post.
3. The blogger publishes the blog post.

So here's what we're going to do:
### Setup a recording
Let's assume you're using Chrome to record your session. If you have any other browser with develper tools, the flow will be very similar.

Start by opening the network tab:

## Step by step

* Create a new empty test by opening the side menu and clicking ‚ÄúNew Test‚Äù (If you just signed-up you might be already in the new test page)

* Give your new test a short description `My First Test`

* Set the value of the URL for Request \#1 to be - `https://loadmill-test-blog.herokuapp.com`. This is a ghost blogging server we are using for testing and demos, so can use it for your test. 
You might see the tested domain showing up in a _red_ chip at the bottom of the page, this is OK for now (This is because we haven't proved ownership of this tested domain yet, we can fix that later)

* Let‚Äôs run a trial run to make sure that our test scenario is configured correctly. Click the ‚ÄúTRY IT‚Äù button at the bottom of the page, this will open the ‚ÄúTRY IT‚Äù dialog. Make sure the first option \(Run Remotely\) is selected and click the ‚ÄúRUN‚Äù button.

* Wait for the trial run to finish successfully and click Request \#1 to expand it and view its response \(There should be no errors\).

* Now that we know that our scenario is configured correctly we can run it as a load test with multiple users. Click the ‚ÄúLOAD TEST‚Äù button to open the ‚ÄúRun a load test‚Äù dialog. Set the test duration to 2 minutes and the number of maximum test users to 5 and click the ‚ÄúRUN‚Äù button. \(note: Until you have verified ownership over all the tested domains included in the test scenario you won‚Äôt be able to run a load test with more than 5 concurrent users\)

* You are now running your first load test, it simulates 5 concurrent users loading our blog homepage by sending HTTP GET requests to `https://loadmill-test-blog.herokuapp.com` repeatedly. Hover your mouse over the graph to inspect average performance over time.

## Using parameters and extracting response values

* In our first simple test we have simulated users loading the homepage our blog, our second test is going to simulate several users publishing new entries to the blog.
* First create a new empty test.
* Only logged in users can post to our blog, so let's start by executing a login request and store the authentication token returned by it into a parameter for later use.

  * Set the Request \#1 method to `POST` and its URL to - `https://loadmill-test-blog.herokuapp.com/ghost/api/v0.1/authentication/token/`

  * Click the ‚ÄòADVANCED‚Äô button to expand the advanced section of the request

  * Update the request description to `Blog Login`

  * Set the Content-Type to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` \(last in the list\).

  * And paste this as the request body - `grant_type=password&username=a@b.com&password=Test1234&client_id=ghost-admin&client_secret=b91601629baf`

  * Expand the ‚ÄúSet Parameters‚Äù card and set a value to a parameter named `access_token` using a `JSONPath` extractor querying for `access_token`. This will create a value extractor that will execute a [JSONPath query](http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) against the JSON response of the request and extract the authentication token into a parameter named `access_token`.

  * Verify that a value was set to the parameter `access_token` by the `JSONPath` extractor by expanding the ‚ÄòVerify Response‚Äô card of the request and creating an assertion. Add an assertion that states that the `access_token` parameter `Is Not Empty`.

  * Click the ‚ÄúTRY IT‚Äù and execute a trial run to make sure it is working.

* Now that we have the authentication token stored in `access_token` we can use it to publish on our blog

  * Create a new request by clicking the "+ ADD REQUEST" button below the first request.
  * Set it as a `POST` request to `https://loadmill-test-blog.herokuapp.com/ghost/api/v0.1/posts/`
  * Expand the advance section and set its description to `Publish Blog Post`
  * Set the Content-Type to `application/json` and the body to this JSON- 
```json
{
       "posts": [
          {
             "title": "Title ${__random_chars}",
             "slug": "${__random_chars}",
             "markdown": "Text ${__random_chars}",
             "status": "published"
          }
       ]
}
```

  * This JSON body defines the blog post that we are going to publish. Notice that we have used one of Loadmill's built-in parameters to make it a little more interesting - `${__random_chars}`. The `__random_chars` parameter will change to a 10 random characters during test/trial execution.

  * Now, lets use the `access_token` parameter value we extracted from the login response to authenticate this request. Expand the header card of publish request and add a header with the name `Authorization` and the value `Bearer  ${access_token}`

  * Run a trial of the whole scenario and go to `https://loadmill-test-blog.herokuapp.com/` to see that our blog posts are getting published.

* Now that we know that our full scenario is working we can run it as a load test. Click the "LOAD TEST" button at the bottom of the test and run the test üéâ
