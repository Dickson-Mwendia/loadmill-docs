# Recording settings

Use the advanced Recording Settings to create meaningful replay-able tests that are easy to configure. Team Admins can control these settings [on this page](https://www.loadmill.com/app/user/settings/recordings).

{% hint style="info" %}
**Reduce Global Parameters** is the only setting enabled by default that makes sure only relevant parameters will be created during the recording import.

ðŸ‘‡ These are recording rules you can add & configure for our [Chrome recorder extension](https://docs.loadmill.com/working-with-the-recorder#loadmill-chrome-recorder-extension) & [recorder](https://docs.loadmill.com/working-with-the-recorder#loadmill-node-recorder). 
{% endhint %}

### Split sessions by URLs \(for the [Recorder](https://docs.loadmill.com/working-with-the-recorder#loadmill-node-recorder) use only\)

In general we want the test cases created based on recorded data, to be short and focused as possible. By default, Loadmill will split a recorded user session into two separate Loadmill test flow, if the user hasn't been active for 5 minutes. 

In many cases, you will want to control when a session is split into separate test cases. Using this setting, you can add API URLs that will define the beginning of a new test case each time they are called.

{% hint style="warning" %}
ðŸ§  **Note:** You can also use raw JavaScript to fire an event from your code to splits a recorded session:`navigator.serviceWorker.controller.postMessage({ type: "reset-session" });`
{% endhint %}

### URL Filters

Use this setting to filter API calls that are not relevant for your tests i.e. marketing, monitoring, analytics and other external integrations.

### Special Keys

Use this setting to manage important Special Keys located in your POST requests body. This way, we can make sure they wonâ€™t be missed during the recording processing phase.

### Entities Synonyms

Entities Synonyms help us detect same entities with different names like a 'Jet' and an 'Airplane'.

Here you can add and manage entities synonyms. This way, we can make sure they wonâ€™t be missed during the recording processing phase. Synonyms must be entered in a list and separated by commas. i.e. Plane, Aircraft, Jet.

### Ignored Keys

Ignored keys are a list of keys that will be ignored while generating tests from recordings.  
Keys in this list will never be extracted to a parameter in the created tests.

### Default values

Default values are a list of keys that once detected will be assigned with a default value. This value may be overridden on runtime.

### Non-Secret Keys \(for the [Recorder](https://docs.loadmill.com/working-with-the-recorder#loadmill-node-recorder) use only\)

Non-secret keys will be used to identify and record values even when recording in secure mode.  
Keys and paths to identify non-secret values are given in a JSONPath-like syntax.

{% hint style="warning" %}
\*\*\*\*ðŸ§  **Note** : Do not record private user data. It is recommended to test these keys locally before recording real users.
{% endhint %}

### Regex replacers

Regex replacers will be used to identify any strings that match the regex and extract them as a parameter.

### Strict Response Validation

When enabled, this option will add JSON Schema assertion to every recorded JSON response.

### Automatic extractions and assertions

Configure which JSON keys should be extracted into parameters and which assertions should be created for them. For example, I've recorded a test flow that includes the "total\_score" JSON key and it should be equal to 100 at the beginning of the test flow, so I can add an automatic extraction and assertion for it:

Thus, when uploading a recording, Loadmill will automatically create the extraction and assertion in the test flow in case there is such a JSON key.
