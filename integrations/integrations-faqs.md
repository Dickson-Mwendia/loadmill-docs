**npm Module**

Q: I’m using your npm module but there are flows that are not run although I assigned labels to them.  


A: That’s great that you are using our labels feature, just one more thing to do is [to check the CI toggle](https://www.npmjs.com/package/loadmill) within the flows and you are all set.
