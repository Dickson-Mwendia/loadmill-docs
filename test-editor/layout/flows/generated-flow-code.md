# Generated Flow Code

After uploading your flow/scenario to Loadmill, its sophisticated AI generates a complete automated dynamic test build that you can easily view, edit and integrate. The generated code is located at the top of the editor and is written and saved in `.yaml`

You can edit your test code through the Loadmill platform or through your IDE by setting up Data Sync to your repository. See here how to enable Data Sync to your Test Suite.
