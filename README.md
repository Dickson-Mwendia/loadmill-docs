# What is Loadmill?

Loadmill helps companies move faster by keeping R&D teams focused on what matters. 

Regression testing is a bottleneck. Developers should spend less time testing and more time on solving meaningful problems.

Loadmill automates backend regression testing by replaying real user behavior. Using smart recordings, Loadmill can create and replay thousands of API tests based on actual user flows within minutes.

## What can Loadmill do for me?

Loadmill is a SaaS automated backend testing platform in which you can create and execute API and Load tests for your application. It differs from other services due to its usage of real web traffic to generate the load on the tested server. This allows us to test your application from countless geographic locations and computers - simulating real usage patterns more authentically.

Since we use existing user sessions rather than virtual machines, we are able to offer this service with a much simpler and more affordable [pay-as-you-go pricing model](https://www.loadmill.com/#pricing).

If you'd like to learn more, have a look at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Y13BkbNLpo) - it explains the general idea.

## What canâ€™t it do?

Loadmill does not simulate browser/client side activity in any way - we test your server from the network layer and provide advanced parameterization capabilities to let you define the flow of information from one request to the next.
