  5\. There are three options how to install the recorder:

* Option 1: [Server side](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@loadmill/node-recorder) aka Node
* Option 2: Client side aka HTML
* Option 3: Testing in Developer Tools aka DEVTOOLS

Choose a relevant option for you and right after you've installed the recorder - the application will appear in the applications table.
