# Quickstart



Loadmill has several ways to compose full API scenarios - the most common is [Loadmill Composer Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/loadmill-test-composer/gdkmnfehipofdefhpegbgkkocinlaofd?hl=en). This extension allows you to compose your API test scenario while browsing your application. It can register any type of incoming and ongoing API calls from the server.&#x20;
