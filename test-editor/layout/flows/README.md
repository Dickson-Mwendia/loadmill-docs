# Flows

A flow is a composed set of correlated API requests registered from an operation made by the user. A flow can represent any type of operation like adding and deleting a user to a group chat or simply going through a checkout process.

You can register flows through the [Test Composer Chrome Extension](broken-reference) or adding the Loadmill User Behavior Module on your server.&#x20;

When uploading your flow/test scenario to Loadmill, youâ€™ll see the flow added to your test suite on the left side of the platform. By default, the name is the date and time you uploaded your test but make sure to rename it to, most commonly, the name of the operation you composed to a test.
