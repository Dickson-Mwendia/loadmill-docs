# Billing

The account admins can navigate to **Settings =&gt; Billing** to manage the account subscription plan, payment method and download Usage Report. 

Subscription Plan shows your current plan, what your maximum allowed concurrency is and how many test minutes you have used this month. See an example below:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2021-01-06-at-9.14.07.png)

It shows that you can run tests with 50 concurrent user sessions maximum. You also have 60 test minutes for Load tests and can run up to 100 API test flows this month. 

{% hint style="info" %}
ðŸ§™â™‚ API Test Flow Runs: we count only test flow runs that were run as a part of the Test Suite \(via the Run Suite button\) and donâ€™t count single test flow runs with regards to billing.
{% endhint %}

In case you need more credit, you can easily upgrade your subscription plan by clicking on **Change Plan**. Keep track of your monthly usage by using [this report](https://docs.loadmill.com/account-settings/billing/usage-report).
