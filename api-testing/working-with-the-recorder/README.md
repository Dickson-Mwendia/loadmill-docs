Loadmill recordings allow you to capture live traffic in your QA or Production environment and replay it as API tests.

The traffic is split to different sessions by its source \(different IPs\) and intermissions between user actions. 

In order to record traffic in a specific environment you first need to install the Loadmill recorder as detailed in the next section.
