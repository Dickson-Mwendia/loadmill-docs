**What happens next?** Loadmill creates the **loadmill-sync** branch and the **loadmill-suites** folder in the repository. ****In addition, a new file with the Test Suite data is created in the **loadmill-suites** folder. Its name matches the Test Suite ID. 

Easily navigate to the commit by clicking on **GO TO COMMIT** at the bottom left corner of the screen.
