### JSONPath

Use this extractor to extract values from JSON responses. JSONPath is a query language for JSON objects, much like XPath for XMLs.

You can test your JSONPath expressions using this useful online tool - [link](https://jsonpath.com/) and see some great examples on this page - [link](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/index.html#e2).

### jQuery

Use this extractor to extract values from HTML or XML responses. jQuery extraction syntax is very similar to XPath and may be very useful to extract values from HTML pages \(such as [security tokens](https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf/tokens)\).
